# Data Analysis -Tasks
Set of real world data Analysis tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

## Background Information:

This project includes multiple Analysis  projects to analys data using Python Pandas, Matplotlib libraries 

Data downloaded from www.kaggle.com data sources.

Projects Include :
1. Cars Analysis
2. Idia Census 2011 Data analysis
3. Iris dataset Analysis
4. Luncon Police Data with Vehicle Violations Analysis.

6. Weather Data Analysis.

We start by cleaning our data. Tasks during this section include:
- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)


To answer questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:
- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
